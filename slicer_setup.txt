Bed Dimensions:
X0 - X415
Y0 - Y424

These are 'reduced' seeing the endstops are now -ve numbers. But the X0/Y0
positions are set to be a few mm onto the Bed, and so are the X & Y Max
values (a few mm over the bed).
It makes more sense that the 'visible' bed runs from 0 - Max, and any
positions off the bed are a -ve number.

To set this up in Klipper, the printer.cfg has [stepper_ ] position_min and position_endstop both set to the the same negative number.
The maximums in the printer.cfg are what the printer CAN move to, but in the
slicer you limit those to only have maximums that remain over the printable
bed
