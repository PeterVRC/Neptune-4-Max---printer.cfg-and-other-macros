The Z_Offset value in the printer.cfg is a value telling how high
above the nozzle the Z Endstop, or Pprobe, is.
An Inductive Probe will always be HIGHER up than the nozzle, by a 
few millimetres. (eg maybe 2mm). This is so it is always above any 
printing layer. Even on the same printer model this can be some 
small value different, due to mounting tolerances or adjustment.
In most Inductive Probe setups the Probe is also used as the Z Endstop.
So once they Home the printer will know a certain Z_Stepper position 
as what the Endstop was and then it will offset that by the "Z_Offset"
value that is stored to work out the actual Nozzle height and what
Z_Step position will then be Z=0.

Z_Offset will always be a positive value (for an Inductive Probe).

A higher value will cause the final calculated Z=0 position to 
be LOWER down.


The Z_Offset, once it has even been set, will be saved into the 
SAVE_CONFIG section at the very end of the printer.cfg file.

#*# [probe]
#*# z_offset = 1.10

This section is not meant to be edited by users, but you CAN without issue - as long as you know what you are doing and don't mess things up in there!
So you can edit the Z_Offset value directly if you want to - thus not needing to use any screen or Fluidd system, if they are flakey and unreliable for some reason.
Best is to USE the screen to fine tune the Z_Offset when you print and note down the exact AMOUNT you altered it by - NOT the actual value it shows(!!) - then you can edit the SAVE_CONFIG section later. You can even edit and save it while it is printing, but you won't be able to restart Klipper to get it to use it until printing has finished.

You will (might?) find that the value you have in the SAVE_CONFIG section is NOT the same as what you see in Fluidd or on the printer's Screen for Z_Offset. The Screen and Fluidd tend to be the same value, but not what the SAVE_CONFIG has. I am not sure why they are different. It suggests that the printer system uses some different place to save the Z_Offset (or whatever they chose to name it), though Klipper itself is who needs it for its calculations. The manufacturer COULD alter Klipper so it does this a different way, but why? And also, the SAVE_CONFIG section DOES get updated at least the first time a Z_Offset change is made on the printer Screen, or Fluidd. You can see that if you have the SAVE_CONFIG Z-Offset section removed, and it will be put back.
The whole Z_Offset system/process, of the Elegoo system, seems unclear to work out what is truly going on with it all !

With the Neptune 4 Max (and probably all Neptunes I would expect), what I have found is that the value on the Screen, or in Fluidd, which both will show the identical thing, is a measure of a CHANGE. It is NOT the Z_Offset value, as per stored in the printer.cfg (SAVE_CONFIG section).
Take this case:  The printer.cfg, SAVE_CONFIG section, has Z_Offset=0.800  Then on the Screen/Fluidd you might see 0.120  I am not sure how they arrive at that 0.120 starting value (but I will find out!), but if you adjust the value - let's say to 0.100 - that new DIFFERENCE is what the Z_Offset will be changed by in the printer.cfg   It reduced by 0.020 so then that 0.800 Z_Offset will be reduced by that also, and then will be 0.780
So once again, the Screen/Fluid value is NOT what is in the printer.cfg.

I will do some tests, but I THINK the system starts with the Z_Offset value that the printer.cfg has to have, in its initial state, up in the [Probe] section. Once the Z_Offset is ever changed via the Screen, or Fluidd, the new value is written down in SAVE_CONFIG section of the printer.cfg and the Z_Stepper entry is commented out (but is still there). From now on Klipper will use the SAVE_CONFIG value of Z_Offset. And then the above paragraph Z_Offset adjusting sequence is what continues....
